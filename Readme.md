This website is a self-created website which acts as way for my to show off my skills, intrests, working experience and achievements to any future employee. 
My design process for this website is that i wanted it to be simple in design, but look neat and tidy at the same time. I also wanted one section of my website to contain a javascript implementation so as to show that i know how to ues a bit of javascript.

The top part of my website is a navigation bar which i created myself. Whenever a user clicks on one of the button, it would open a seperate html file to display a different set of content and design.
